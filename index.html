            <h1>Pushover</h1>
            <p>
            Pushover is a fun puzzle game originally published by Ocean in 1992. In this game you control
            an ant that can walk along platforms that are connected with ladders. On those platforms are
	    dominos that need to fall according to some rules.
	    <ul>
	    <li>All dominos must fall and none must crash into another</li>
	    <li>One special domino must fall as last domino and that domino triggers the exit door to open
	    when you enter the exit door the level has been completed</li>
	    <li>You may rearrange as many dominos as you want, except for the trigger. You may not place dominos
	    in front of the doors, except for the vanishing domino.</li>
	    <li>You may push push once to start a chain reaction with the dominos leading to the
	    fall of all of them</li>
	    <li>All this has to be done within a time limit (which is normally generous)</li>
	    <li>There are 11 different dominos that behave differently when pushed, some fall, some not, some
	    wait a bit before they fall, some raise, some toppler until they meet an obstacle</li>
	    <li>There is a help in the game and introductory levels that show how all the dominos work</li>
	    </ul>
	    What you find on this web page is a faithful reimplementation of the original game. Although we
	    removed the original password scheme as it will not work on an open source game. We also started
	    assing new functionalities and new domino types used in some new levels.
	    <p>
	    Right now the game uses reformatted graphics for some of the themes and we already have
	    updated graphics for other themes. We are in the process of replacing them with new high resolution
	    graphics.
            <p>

                  <p>Version 0.0.4 brings a pile of new usability
                  enhancements....
                  <ul>
                    <li>profiles so that more than one player can play the game on the same computer using the same account
                    <li>2 solve states. When a level is solved not meeting the time constraint it still gets marked as solved, but with a different marker
                    <li>speed-up the fade-in animation when a level is started
                    <li>new type of domino: counter blocker, but with no levels using it, yet
                    <li>mission and level names are now translated
                  </ul>
                  <p>...general improvements...
                  <ul>
                    <li>Italian translation (we have up to date translations for Czech, German, Spanish and Italian and incomplete translations for French and Russian)
                    <li>3 new music pieces (only one theme music and a title music is now missing)
                    <li>expect for a proper level solution that dominos don't lean against a step this makes level 64 harder, enforced level 64 to play again by removing a useless ladder
                    <li>new type of domino: counter blocker, but with no levels using it, yet
                    <li>improved help window, better suited for translation and improved texts for the dominos
                    <li>a few new levels in A&amp;V
                  </ul>

                  <p>...and bug fixes
                  <ul>
                    <li>fix to the background images of 3 dungeon levels
                    <li>pushover can now quit using the window close button on the window header
                    <li>fixes to typos
                    <li>support lua 5.2
                  </ul>
                  <p>We are in the process of registering Pushover with the <a
                    href="http://translationproject.org">Translation
                    Project</a><img src='website/images/extern.png'>. So if you want to help translating Pushover
                  you are welcome to join the project.
                  <p>Also we are still looking for an artist that can repaint
                  the ant... this seems to be not for the faint of heart as we
                  did have 3 different artists asking for the information but
                  none of them returned with any results. So if you feel keen
                  mail us.

                <td>
                  <p>Version 0.0.2 has been released. This release features
                  internationalisation (translations for German are complete,
                  Russian and Czech translations are available but incomplete),
                  graphic replacements for 4 out of 9 themes, original music
                  for 5 out of 9 themes. 
                  <p>We also created 6 new levels in the A&amp;V levelset.
                  <p>There are some small fixes to the game mechanics that
                  makes the game behave nearly identical to the original
                  <p>I hopefully fixed an endian problem with the graphics
                  loader
                  <p>We still need an artist that can recreate the graphics
                  for the ant. So if you think that that could be fun to do,
                  please contact me. I have prepared everything to make it as
                  easy as possible.
                  <p>Also if you want to translate the texts of Pushover you
                  can contact me. We are using the <a
                    href="http://www.gnu.org/software/freefont/index.html">FreeSans</a><img src='images/extern.png'> true type font. So
                  as long as you use only glyphs within that font (and stay
                  with left to right writing) there is no problem. If you want
                  right to left text I will need your assistance to program
                  that.

		  levels. Sound effects are in place. The original graphics have been converted and included. Replacement
		  graphics for the dominos exist. There are a few small fixes when compared to the original, for example
		  level 49 from the original offered a probably not intended solution. We've also prepared some new
		  levels. They were designed by Volker and I have been the tester and sometimes provided an idea.
		  <p>
		  So have fun playing and remembering the old times
